## Feature's

- Mobile Rostering Made Easy With Staff Rostering App : RosterElf staff scheduling app allows managers to create, update, and re-publish rosters from the convenience of their smartphones
- Digital clock-in-out with our time clock app : Using GPS location settings in the staff roster app, employees can only clock in for shifts when they are physically on-site. This is a critical feature, especially for large-scale venues or events.
- Staff Scheduling App:  RosterElf's iPhone and Android staff rostering apps include several features to help you manage your team on the go, including My Shifts, a simple and powerful way for everyone in the business to keep on top of all their upcoming shifts.
- Workforce management made for managers: RosterElf's roster app for Android and iOS allows both manager access settings and employee access settings. Ideal to use as an employee scheduling app for full-time, part-time, shift workers, casual workers, and contractors.
